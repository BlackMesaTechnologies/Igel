# BaseX 7.6 Property File.

#### To localize:
#### - Set DBPATH to location for BaseX binary data 
#### - Set WEBPATH to location for BaseX query data 
#### - Set USER and PASSWORD to suitable values
####
#### For security reasons, DBPATH should normally not be 
#### Web-accessible, and WEBPATH should either be
#### inaccessible or carefully protected.  (Obscurity
#### doesn't guarantee security, but exposing the names of
#### known queries and their text is just not a good idea.)
